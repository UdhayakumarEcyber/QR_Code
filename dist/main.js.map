All data is\n  // referenced by a code, which represents one or more values from the\n  // original input stream.  All input bytes can be referenced as the same\n  // value as an output code.  So if you didn't want any compression, you\n  // could more or less just output the original bytes as codes (there are\n  // some details to this, but it is the idea).  In order to achieve\n  // compression, values greater then the input range (codes can be up to\n  // 12-bit while input only 8-bit) represent a sequence of previously seen\n  // inputs.  The decompressor is able to build the same mapping while\n  // decoding, so there is always a shared common knowledge between the\n  // encoding and decoder, which is also important for \"timing\" aspects like\n  // how to handle variable bit width code encoding.\n  //\n  // One obvious but very important consequence of the table system is there\n  // is always a unique id (at most 12-bits) to map the runs.  'A' might be\n  // 4, then 'AA' might be 10, 'AAA' 11, 'AAAA' 12, etc.  This relationship\n  // can be used for an effecient lookup strategy for the code mapping.  We\n  // need to know if a run has been seen before, and be able to map that run\n  // to the output code.  Since we start with known unique ids (input bytes),\n  // and then from those build more unique ids (table entries), we can\n  // continue this chain (almost like a linked list) to always have small\n  // integer values that represent the current byte chains in the encoder.\n  // This means instead of tracking the input bytes (AAAABCD) to know our\n  // current state, we can track the table entry for AAAABC (it is guaranteed\n  // to exist by the nature of the algorithm) and the next character D.\n  // Therefor the tuple of (table_entry, byte) is guaranteed to also be\n  // unique.  This allows us to create a simple lookup key for mapping input\n  // sequences to codes (table indices) without having to store or search\n  // any of the code sequences.  So if 'AAAA' has a table entry of 12, the\n  // tuple of ('AAAA', K) for any input byte K will be unique, and can be our\n  // key.
